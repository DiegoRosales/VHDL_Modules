<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="1767" delta="old" >HDL ADVISOR - Resource sharing has identified that some arithmetic operations in this design can share the same physical resources for reduced device utilization. For improved clock frequency you may try to disable resource sharing.
</msg>

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="3231" delta="old" >The small RAM &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">Mram_array_reg</arg>&gt; will be implemented on LUTs in order to maximize performance and save block RAM resources. If you want to force its implementation on block, use option/constraint ram_style.
</msg>

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="3217" delta="old" >HDL ADVISOR - Register &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">data_reg</arg>&gt; currently described with an asynchronous reset, could be combined with distributed RAM &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="2">Mram_array_reg</arg>&gt; for implementation on block RAM resources if you made this reset synchronous instead.

<msg type="warning" file="Xst" num="1710" delta="old" >FF/Latch &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="1">counter_current_3</arg>&gt; (without init value) has a constant value of <arg fmt="%d" index="2">0</arg> in block &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="3">SPI_MASTER_RX</arg>&gt;. This FF/Latch will be trimmed during the optimization process.

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="2169" delta="old" >HDL ADVISOR - Some clock signals were not automatically buffered by XST with BUFG/BUFR resources. Please use the buffer_type constraint in order to insert these buffers to the clock signals to help prevent skew problems.
